## Unit 1. Data Processing
## Project 1. Who wants to be a millionaire of film distribution.

### Task
Given the dataset (refer to "movie_bd_v5.csv"),  
find answers to the 27 suggested questions,  
using Pandas data analysis methods learned in the current module.

### Points scored in Quiz
27 out of 27  
(all on the first attempt)

### Self-reflection output
1. Which part of your work you especially satisfied with?  
--- Preprocessing functions that help to fill answers dictionary :)

2. What didn't work out the way you wanted? What else is worth working on?  
--- Wanted to try working with dates in Python, but didn't have time to  
    compose alternate solutions that use corresponding methods.  
    Need to improve time management.  

3. What interesting and useful have you learned in this module?  
--- Manipulating dataframes/series is super handy with Pandas!  
    Filtering, grouping, pivot tables, sorting never were that fun!

4. What is your main result of completing this project?  
--- I overcame my uncertainty about working with datasets.

5. Are you planning to change your learning strategy for subsequent modules?  
--- I am positive regarding my current results, though likely I will try to  
    move back to short & often learning sessions instead of long & rare.

### NOTES on running the .ipynb Notebook
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ (Google account is required).
2. Click on "Upload" tab and choose .ipynb file (or drag & drop it there).
3. Also upload "movie_bd_v5.csv" file to /content dir in runtime.
4. Choose "Runtime > Run all" (hotkey: Ctrl+F9).
   "View > Expand sections" could be useful for better experience.
